## 2D CPP

We have compiled more than 80 datasets usually used by the researchers when evaluating and comparing their solution method implementations. At is was expected, many formats to define the instances characteristics have emerged from this diversity, and to ease the data input for the implementation of the solution methods, we converted all the instances to JSON format.

## 3D CPP

We provide the datasets (original and JSON file format) defined in the follwing works:

* Martello, S., Pisinger, D., Vigo, D.: The Three-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem. Oper. Res. 48, 256â€“267 (2000). DOI: [10.1287/opre.48.2.256.12386](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.48.2.256.12386).

## SSCFLP

We provide the datasets usually referred to as Delmaire, Holmberg, OR, Yang and TBED1.
