<blockquote>
  <p>Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) workflows are commonly developed using frameworks and tools that provide a set of useful pre-configured components to develop complete ETL packages. The pattern concept for ETL development is being studied as a way to simplify and improve the ETL development lifecycle. Patterns are independent composite tasks that can be changed without affecting the ETL structure. The pattern implementation reveals several challenges when used with existing ETL tools, mainly due to the monolith architectural style usually followed. The use of small and loosely-coupled components provided by the microservices architectural style can improve the way ETL patterns are used. In this paper, we present an analysis for the use of microservices for ETL application development using patterns.</p>
